# Image Gallery

A template built with create-react-app has been provided to you. You can find instructions for running the app in the [environment-instructions](environment-instructions.md) file.

This challenge is intended to take two hours. Focus on writing clean, readable, extensible code.

### Specifications

Build an image gallery.

- A user should be able to add images to the gallery via entering the URL of an image on the web into a text field.
- The gallery should display thumbnails of all images.
- When a thumbnail is clicked, that image should display at a large size below the thumbnails.
- There should be buttons by the large image to display the previous and next image, such that the user can scroll through the gallery without clicking the thumbnails every time.
- The previous and next buttons should loop if the user is on the first or last image.

Add some basic CSS, and add a few tests. You can choose to either use the testing suite included with create-react-app, or you can import any testing suite you like.
